# Social Media Announcements for v0.2.0

## LinkedIn: The "Developer Experience" Focus

**Headline: Stop building boring API clients. Start generating Artifacts. 🌌**

Let’s be honest: most CLI tools feel like they were built in 1998. We decided to change that.

Introducing **GIDEVO v0.2.0**—the API tool that treats Developer Experience (DX) as a first-class citizen.

We didn't just add features; we overhauled the entire engine:
✨ **The "Avant-Garde" UI**: A stunning new interface that makes code generation feel like piloting a spaceship.
🔐 **Fort Knox Security**: Your API tokens are now guarded by a hybrid System Keychain + AES-256 vault.
🐍 **Python Superpowers**: We now generate full **Pydantic** models. Type hints, runtime validation, and zero boilerplate.

It’s type-safe. It’s secure. And frankly, it looks incredible in your terminal.

Stop writing boilerplate. Start synthesizing.
