## Purpose

Describe the end-to-end workflows that the public product currently supports.

## On this page

- [Primary workflows](#primary-workflows)
- [Recovery behavior](#recovery-behavior)
- [Verification](#verification)

## Primary workflows

1. Validate a specification before generation; use workflow --dry-run to validate planned output without writing files.
2. Run doctor with a specification and output target to diagnose project readiness.

## Recovery behavior

Show actionable errors, preserve safe user input where possible, and explain the next recovery action. For destructive or irreversible actions, require confirmation and document the available undo or export path.

## Verification

- Exercise a happy path, an empty state, a validation error, and a recovery path.
- Confirm instructions match visible labels and current API/UI behavior.
