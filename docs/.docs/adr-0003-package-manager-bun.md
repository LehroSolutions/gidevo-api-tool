# ADR-0003: Package manager selection (Bun vs alternatives)

## Status
Accepted — Bun-first

## Context
The constellation mixes Next.js/Vite/Node CLIs with pure Python services. Bun is excellent for JS/TS install + runtime ergonomics, but it is not a Python package manager.

## Decision
GIDEVO API Tool is a JavaScript/TypeScript codebase. **Bun is the preferred package manager and script runner.** Use Node only as a compatibility fallback.

### Recommendation
Adopt Bun for install/run/test/build scripts.

## Bun ideal when
- Dependencies are npm packages
- Scripts are Node/TypeScript CLIs or Vite/Next apps
- Fast local install and `bunx` DX matter

## Bun not ideal when
- Runtime is CPython/FastAPI/pytest
- Native Python packaging/metadata is required
- Tooling assumes pip/uv lock semantics exclusively

## Consequences
- JS/TS packages declare `packageManager: bun@...` and ship `bunfig.toml`
- npm lockfiles are archived as legacy artifacts
- Contributors generate `bun.lock` with `bun install` on a network machine
- Python packages keep their existing tooling
